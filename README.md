# Lab07-Collections

We are tasked with creating a custom generic collection that is used to simulate a deck of cards.
Wee need to add at least 10 cards to the deck, and then to deal that deck out between two players and the Dealer keeps the remaining cards.

# Solution
What it looks like in the console if all goes right
At this time, it isn't played with the user, so no action needed from the user.
